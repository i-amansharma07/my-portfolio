# But what even is a database?

### Motivation:

As a backend developer, it's crucial to have a basic understanding of how a database management system (DBMS) works. This knowledge can make you a more well-rounded developer, boost your confidence, and help you make better decisions when choosing a database for your application. We will delve deeper into the internal workings of a DBMS, the basic terminology, and the primary components and subsystems that form a DBMS. But before going forward, let's make sure we have our terminology on the same page.

As a side note, please be aware that while no specific prerequisites are required, it is beneficial to have some prior experience working with databases to fully grasp the upcoming content.

So when we refer to databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL, we are actually talking about database management systems (DBMS). A database is simply a collection of data or information that is stored and can be retrieved, while a DBMS encompasses everything around the database, such as the query language, security, replication, transactions, and more. A database management system, as the name suggests, has many underlying subsystems or layers that ensure the ACID properties are upheld. Thereâ€™s no common blueprint for database management system design, as each database is built slightly differently. However, there are common components and subsystems that we can observe out in the wild.

To better explain this, let's assume we are firing a single database command:

```sql
SELECT * FROM urls WHERE code = "ffd9f9";
```

Upon firing this, each of the layers starts their work - starting with:

### 1. Transport or Communication Layer:

The communication layer is responsible for managing the communications between the client applications and the actual database system. Mainly there are two types of architecture:

- **Two-tier architecture**
- **Three-tier architecture**

In a two-tier architecture, the application resides on the client machine and directly interacts with the database system on the server machine through query language statements. But as the amount of data grew, so did the scale and security aspects of this layer, necessitating an update. Soon, this architecture became less common in modern applications.

In contrast, the three-tier architecture is more commonly used in modern database applications. In this architecture, the client machine acts solely as a front-end and does not contain any direct database calls. The front-end communicates with an application server, which in turn communicates with the database system to access data. The business logic of the application is embedded in the application server. As there is less coupling, this provides better security and performance.

Now, when a request comes to a database, they usually come in the form of a query expressed in some query language and are received by the client communication component. Based on the type of query received, the query is passed to either the query processor or to the execution engine.  
The Communication layer is also responsible for handling inter-cluster communication, which is communication between different database nodes in a database cluster.

### 2. Query Processor:

On the book _Database System Concepts_, right after the network communication layer section, you'll find this piece of text:

> We do not expect users to write their queries in a way that suggests the most efficient evaluation plan. Rather, it is the responsibility of the system to construct a query evaluation plan that minimizes the cost of query evaluation; this task is called query optimization.

I absolutely adore this passage, and it's not because it talks down to anyone. Instead, it highlights the remarkable foresight and thoughtfulness that goes into designing these systems.

So, after the request is received, it is passed to the query processor. The query processor interprets, validates, and performs access control and permission checks on the query.

Parsing of a query means that for a given query, we have to identify in how many ways the given request can be fulfilled. Every query must be parsed at least once.  
There are two types of parsing: **soft parsing** and **hard parsing**.

- **Soft parsing** means that the database can reuse a previous execution plan for the same query.
- **Hard parsing** means that the database has to create a new execution plan for the query.

Hard parsing happens when the database can't find a previous execution plan or if the plan is no longer valid. In this case, the Optimizer has to look at all the possible ways to execute the query.
